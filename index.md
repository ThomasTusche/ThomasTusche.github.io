## Welcome to my GitHub Webseit

Since quite a while I'm interested in Cloud Engineering and especially the DevOps / Automatisation part of it. Working with AWS, Terraform, Python, Docker and Kubernetes is a thrilling adventure and there's so much to learn and work on. The purpose of this website is to show my journey going through all this stuff, working on my own project and share my code with you.

### 1) Project: Creating an environment with AWS, Terraform, Docker and Kubernetes for a wordpress website

The first project I want to share with you is an entire infrastructure I created to host a wordpress website on it. 
Nearly all AWS ressources were created with Terraform and deployed via CodePipeline. The Docker container is running
inside a Kubernetes Cluster, which is deployed through a Pipeline aswell.
